The Role of Printer Drivers and Their Importance
===============================================

A printer driver is the essential software that enables your computer or device to communicate with the printer hardware. It translates digital content—photos, brochures, spreadsheets, posters—into printable commands and ensures that the printer can interpret color profiles, resolution, layout, media type, duplex status, ink usage, and more.

Although your device might detect the printer as a basic device and allow standard printing, an uninstalled or incorrect driver limits access to advanced features like:

- Color consistency
- Borderless layouts
- Duplexing
- Print quality settings

The PIXMA iX6820 includes multiple high-performance features such as wireless networking, auto-duplexing, borderless printing, and photo-optimized color profiles. Installing the correct driver is essential to fully unlock these capabilities.
